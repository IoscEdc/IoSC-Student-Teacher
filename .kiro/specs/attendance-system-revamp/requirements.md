# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive revamp of the School Management System's attendance tracking functionality. The new attendance system will provide structured attendance marking with proper authorization controls, automated summary generation, bulk student management capabilities, and role-based access for admins, teachers, and students. The system will ensure data integrity through proper validation and audit trails while providing intuitive interfaces for all user roles.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to mark attendance for my assigned classes and subjects with proper session tracking, so that I can accurately record student participation for each lecture session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a teacher accesses the attendance marking interface THEN the system SHALL display only classes and subjects assigned to that teacher
2. WHEN marking attendance THEN the system SHALL require selection of class, subject, date, and session (e.g., Lecture 1, Lecture 2)
3. WHEN a teacher attempts to mark attendance for an unassigned class/subject THEN the system SHALL deny access and display an authorization error
4. WHEN attendance is marked THEN the system SHALL display students with roll number first, followed by name, and provide individual present/absent checkboxes with visual feedback (green for present, red for absent)
5. WHEN a student's attendance status is changed THEN the system SHALL update only that specific student's status without affecting other students
6. WHEN present checkbox is selected THEN the checkbox SHALL turn green and absent checkbox SHALL be automatically unchecked
7. WHEN absent checkbox is selected THEN the checkbox SHALL turn red and present checkbox SHALL be automatically unchecked
8. WHEN attendance submission is completed THEN the system SHALL display a summary showing total present, absent, late, and excused counts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to manage student enrollment and class assignments in bulk using university ID patterns, so that I can efficiently organize students into appropriate classes without manual individual assignments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN admin accesses bulk student management THEN the system SHALL provide options to assign students based on ID patterns (branch/year/section)
2. WHEN bulk assignment is initiated THEN the system SHALL validate student IDs against the defined university pattern
3. WHEN students are bulk assigned THEN the system SHALL automatically enroll them in the corresponding classes and subjects
4. WHEN assignment conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL display warnings and require admin confirmation before proceeding
5. WHEN bulk operations complete THEN the system SHALL generate a report showing successful assignments and any errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student, I want to view my attendance summary and analytics in a clear dashboard, so that I can track my attendance performance across all subjects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student accesses their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display attendance summaries for all enrolled subjects
2. WHEN viewing attendance data THEN the system SHALL show present/absent/late/excused counts and percentages for each subject
3. WHEN attendance data is displayed THEN the system SHALL include visual charts showing attendance trends over time
4. WHEN a student attempts to access another student's data THEN the system SHALL deny access and maintain data privacy
5. WHEN attendance records are updated THEN the student dashboard SHALL reflect changes in real-time

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to view, edit, and download comprehensive attendance reports and analytics, so that I can monitor overall attendance patterns and make data-driven decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN admin accesses attendance analytics THEN the system SHALL display attendance data for all classes, subjects, and students
2. WHEN filtering attendance data THEN the system SHALL support filters by date range, subject, class, teacher, and attendance status
3. WHEN editing attendance records THEN the system SHALL log all changes with timestamp and admin identifier for audit purposes
4. WHEN downloading reports THEN the system SHALL generate Excel/CSV files with comprehensive attendance data
5. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL display visual charts showing attendance trends, patterns, and statistics

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want attendance operations to be secured with proper authorization and validation, so that data integrity is maintained and unauthorized access is prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any attendance operation is attempted THEN the system SHALL verify user authentication and role-based permissions
2. WHEN attendance is marked THEN the system SHALL validate that the class exists, teacher is assigned, and students are enrolled
3. WHEN attendance data is accessed THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based access controls (teachers see only assigned classes, students see only their own data)
4. WHEN attendance records are modified THEN the system SHALL create audit logs with user, timestamp, and change details
5. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and return appropriate error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want the system to automatically update attendance summaries after each marking session, so that student attendance records are always current and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN attendance is marked or edited THEN the system SHALL automatically recalculate AttendanceSummary for each affected student and subject
2. WHEN attendance updates occur THEN the system SHALL ensure summary calculations include all attendance statuses (present, absent, late, excused)
3. WHEN summary updates fail THEN the system SHALL rollback the attendance changes and display an error message
4. WHEN multiple teachers mark attendance simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent updates without data corruption
5. WHEN attendance summaries are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain historical accuracy and prevent data loss

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to transfer and adjust teacher and student assignments as needed, so that I can maintain flexibility in class organization throughout the academic period.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN admin initiates assignment transfers THEN the system SHALL display current assignments and allow selection of new assignments
2. WHEN teacher assignments are changed THEN the system SHALL update access permissions immediately and notify affected teachers
3. WHEN student transfers occur THEN the system SHALL maintain historical attendance data while updating current enrollments

5. WHEN transfers are completed THEN the system SHALL generate confirmation reports showing all changes made

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want an intuitive attendance marking interface with clear visual feedback and individual student controls, so that I can efficiently and accurately mark attendance without confusion or errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the attendance list THEN the system SHALL display students in a clear format with roll number prominently displayed first, followed by student name
2. WHEN marking attendance THEN the system SHALL provide separate Present and Absent checkboxes for each individual student
3. WHEN Present checkbox is clicked THEN the checkbox SHALL turn green and any previously selected Absent checkbox for that student SHALL be automatically unchecked
4. WHEN Absent checkbox is clicked THEN the checkbox SHALL turn red and any previously selected Present checkbox for that student SHALL be automatically unchecked
